  "aboutMeArt":  "What started as weekly baby ballet classes turned into my passion. I began dabbling in various performing arts from the age of 5. I have training in the RAD, CSTD and Vaganova style of ballet, as well as contemporary, jazz, hip hop and tap dance. I am passionate about creating work and have choreographed various pieces. Aside from dance, I enjoy acting and singing. I have performed in musical theatre productions, short films and choir concerts. I am experienced in teaching ballet, jazz and musical theatre to children and adults. I hope that through teaching I will be able pay it forward and inspire younger dancers to pursue their passions throughout school and beyond."
